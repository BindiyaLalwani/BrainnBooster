Best English learning app and it's so easy to use. The way they teach is amazing it helps me so much. Before using this app I'm so bad at speaking English but now after using cake I can talk easily with others. Best English learning app ever. I will surely recommend this app to my friends and family so that they can learn English in easy way.<hr>

I personally do not think this app will make an absolute beginner become fluent in English. It helps your social English skills (like the kind that helps you communicate with foreigners while not sounding like a noob) but that's intermediate stuff. Frankly I'd rate the app higher if it has written tests, you gotta help people remember the words somehow, probably by typing it out, spelling is important.<hr>
