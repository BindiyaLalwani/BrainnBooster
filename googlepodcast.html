The new interface is terrible. Not sure why it was changed. My favorite podcasts are bunched up at the top. Difficult to read episode details. Going to revert to an old version if possible, or switch to another app. Instead of replying to every review with a broken link (I can't seem to open the URL) explaining the decision to make the interface a mess, why don't you just fix it.

This app is absolutely amazing! A load of podcasts to sit back and listen to! Very clean and slick design, i can think of nothing i would change with it. 5 star app and I hope to see it alive for years!! New favorite app. Also if you have not listened to the podcast, Crime Junkie, i strongly recommend it. I just recently began my Crime Junkie journey and am hooked after 3 episodes!!
