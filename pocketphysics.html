Nice app for short revision. Needs to put some more details in some concepts. Also, are diagrams of lenses in the topic of mirrors, pls fix them.

Not the app if you just want a refresher of the basics of physics laid out in an orderly fashion. Just random topics in no particular order. Probably good if you are studying physics.
