The concept is amazing. There are some minor visual bugs, and there aren't many intermediate or advanced courses, but other than those using the app is painless and rewarding (especially for beginners). This app is not going to replace coding on a computer, since answering multiple-choice questions ...

So far, i think this is great! It's my first time I learn about coding, and this app make me pretty understand. It brings the learning fun! instead I'm a little bit lack in english, overall I can get it. But maybe my problem now is, i can't play it again, i don't know if that's a limit for free play...

This is an excellent app for extra practice. It helps solidify coding vocabulary in common coding languages. I use this to my advantage after I am done practicing coding on my computer. I highly recommend using this app if you want to learn more about coding languages or if you are looking for an ad...
