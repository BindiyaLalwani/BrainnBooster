This is the most inspirational book one can ever read. I was very glad that this book was written by an Indian (Arun Tiwari) about an Indian whose life journey is so inspiring that it can just turn your life. It shows how a normal young Muslim boy who lived in Rameswharam turned into a famous scientist and then the president of a country like India.by arnav
