App is good with latest news contents. Insights stroies are really good. However its fonts are small and difficult to read who has weak eyesight. Please consider my request to increase the fonts or atleast give option to do that as there is enough screen space is available for bigger fonts. Thanks.

The Dark Mode. is. terrible. The opening page of the app is in full white, the notifications are in white, there is no Auto Dark Mode, the browser which shows the full news is in light, this app is just terrible nowadays. The notifications are a mess, the categories of news I choose not to show any news of, still show me anyway, and to top it all of, this app is updated once in 6 months, which just means this app is not the focus anymore for this company.
